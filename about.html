    <h2>LostPhones.com – Why We Built This</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
      <p>We created this site after losing a phone ourselves — and watching it jump from New York to China in a matter of weeks.</p>
      <p>The panic was real. Every hour felt like a scramble to figure out what to lock, what to change, who to call, and what actually mattered.</p>
      <p>It took a lot of time, research, and trial-and-error to understand the right steps to protect the phone, the data on it, and our identity.<br>
      Most advice online was scattered, outdated, or written for tech experts.</p>
      <p>So we built the guide we wish we had.</p>
      <p>LostPhones.com is a simple, step-by-step resource that tells you <strong>exactly</strong> what to do — clearly, calmly, and in the right order — so you can protect your accounts, secure your number, and make the best possible decisions at a stressful moment.</p>
      <p><strong>If this site makes your situation even a little easier, it has done its job.</strong></p>
