          <summary>Step 1: Secure your immediate safety</summary>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Take a deep breath and make sure you’re in a safe place. If your phone was stolen, move to a secure location and stay aware of your surroundings. Your physical safety always comes first.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
    
        <details>
          <summary>Step 2: Lock your phone remotely (if possible)</summary>
          <div class="panel">
            <p><strong>iPhone:</strong> Go to iCloud.com/find → sign in → select your device → Mark As Lost or Play Sound.<br>
            <strong>Android:</strong> Go to android.com/find → sign in → Lock or Secure Device.<br>
            This adds a lock screen message and disables Apple Pay / Google Pay.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
    
        <details>
          <summary>Step 3: Do NOT call or text your lost phone yet</summary>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Calling or texting can alert a thief that you’re actively tracking them, which sometimes causes them to wipe or power off the device immediately. Wait until you’ve completed the critical security steps below.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
    
        <details>
          <summary>Step 4: Change your most important passwords NOW</summary>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>From another device, change (in this order):<br>
            • Apple ID / iCloud<br>
            • Google account<br>
            • Email accounts<br>
            • Banking / payment apps<br>
            • Any app with saved credit cards</p>
          </div>
        </details>
    
        <details>
          <summary>Step 5: Suspend or wipe your phone line</summary>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Call your carrier (or log in online) and ask them to suspend service. This prevents fraudulent calls/texts and stops premium charges. You can unsuspend later if the phone is recovered.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
    
        <details>
          <summary>Step 6: Enable Lost Mode / Erase Device (only if needed)</summary>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>If the phone is moving to suspicious locations or you have no hope of recovery, trigger Erase Device. This is permanent — only do it after you’ve secured accounts.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
    
        <details>
          <summary>Step 7: Alert your bank and freeze cards</summary>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Turn off every card linked to Apple Pay, Google Pay, or saved in your phone. Most banks have a one-click “freeze” button in their apps.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
    
        <details>
          <summary>Step 8: File a police report</summary>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Even if recovery odds are low, a police report is required by most insurance plans and helps if identity theft occurs later. Bring the IMEI/serial number (find it on your original box or carrier account).</p>
          </div>
        </details>
    
        <details>
          <summary>Step 9: Monitor accounts for 30 days</summary>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Enable login alerts on every account. Watch for strange logins, password resets, or purchases. Consider a credit freeze if you’re extra worried.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
    
        <details>
          <summary>Step 10: If your phone is recovered</summary>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Turn off Lost Mode, unsuspend your line, and run a full factory reset before restoring your backup. Change all passwords again just to be safe.</p>
