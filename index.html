        <details>
          <summary>Step 1: Secure your immediate safety</summary>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Take a deep breath and make sure you’re in a safe place. If your phone was stolen, move to a secure location and stay aware of your surroundings. Your physical safety always comes first.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
    
        <details>
          <summary>Step 2: Lock your phone remotely (if possible)</summary>
          <div class="panel">
            <p><strong>iPhone:</strong> Go to iCloud.com/find → sign in → select your device → Mark As Lost or Play Sound.<br>
            <strong>Android:</strong> Go to android.com/find → sign in → Lock or Secure Device.<br>
            This adds a lock screen message and disables Apple Pay / Google Pay.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
    
        <details>
          <summary>Step 3: Do NOT call or text your lost phone yet</summary>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Calling or texting can alert a thief that you’re actively tracking them, which sometimes causes them to wipe or power off the device immediately. Wait until you’ve completed the critical security steps below.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
    
        <details>
          <summary>Step 4: Change your most important passwords NOW</summary>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>From another device, change (in this order):<br>
            • Apple ID / iCloud<br>
            • Google account<br>
            • Email accounts<br>
            • Banking / payment apps<br>
            • Any app with saved credit cards</p>
          </div>
        </details>
    
        <details>
          <summary>Step 5: Suspend or wipe your phone line</summary>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Call your carrier (or log in online) and ask them to suspend service. This prevents fraudulent calls/texts and stops premium charges. You can unsuspend later if the phone is recovered.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
    
        <details>
          <summary>Step 6: Enable Lost Mode / Erase Device (only if needed)</summary>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>If the phone is moving to suspicious locations or you have no hope of recovery, trigger Erase Device. This is permanent — only do it after you’ve secured accounts.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
    
        <details>
          <summary>Step 7: Alert your bank and freeze cards</summary>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Turn off every card linked to Apple Pay, Google Pay, or saved in your phone. Most banks have a one-click “freeze” button in their apps.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
    
        <details>
          <summary>Step 8: File a police report</summary>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Even if recovery odds are low, a police report is required by most insurance plans and helps if identity theft occurs later. Bring the IMEI/serial number (find it on your original box or carrier account).</p>
          </div>
        </details>
    
        <details>
          <summary>Step 9: Monitor accounts for 30 days</summary>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Enable login alerts on every account. Watch for strange logins, password resets, or purchases. Consider a credit freeze if you’re extra worried.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
    
        <details>
          <summary>Step 10: If your phone is recovered</summary>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Turn off Lost Mode, unsuspend your line, and run a full factory reset before restoring your backup. Change all passwords again just to be safe.</p>

    <h2>LostPhones.com – Why We Built This</h2>
    <div style="font-size: 1.2rem; max-width: 800px; margin: 2rem auto; line-height: 1.8; text-align: left;">
      <p>We created this site after losing a phone ourselves — and watching it jump from New York to China in a matter of weeks.</p>
      <p>The panic was real. Every hour felt like a scramble to figure out what to lock, what to change, who to call, and what actually mattered.</p>
      <p>It took a lot of time, research, and trial-and-error to understand the right steps to protect the phone, the data on it, and our identity.<br>
      Most advice online was scattered, outdated, or written for tech experts.</p>
      <p>So we built the guide we wish we had.</p>
      <p>LostPhones.com is a simple, step-by-step resource that tells you <strong>exactly</strong> what to do — clearly, calmly, and in the right order — so you can protect your accounts, secure your number, and make the best possible decisions at a stressful moment.</p>
      <p><strong>If this site makes your situation even a little easier, it has done its job.</strong></p>
